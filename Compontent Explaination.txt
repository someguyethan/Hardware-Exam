My explaination for the components used are as follows:

The tilt sensor allows for the left-right movement for Mario (no need for D-pad since there is no up/down movement

Push buttons for A/B; one for jumping, the other for sprinting

Lastly, I added a vibration motor to vibrate the controller when Mario dies, wins, destroys a barrel, or whichever event would require any vibrations to increase immersion
