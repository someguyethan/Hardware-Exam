My explainations for the TinkerCAD process is as follows:

The two push buttons are fairly simple, just taking the binary input from the button into the digital pins

My tilt sensor is fairly simple too, just taking in the analog input from the sensor and sending it to an analog pin on the arduino

For the vibration motor, I am simply using the digital pin from the arduino to power the sensor (whenever that may trigger in game)

I currently have it set up where it vibrates whenever you press the A button, but that is only for testing, the real input would come from the game controlling the arduino
